* As you are aware, the notebook is quite long, that's why we decided to deactivate every plot with a ";" at the end of the cell. 
Runing the code after removing the ";" and running the cell would allow the notebook to display the graph / gif made in the cell.
* Although we strongly recommand not to execute any cell at all, as you know, some cell can take up to 5-6min to run. We saved
every plot / gplot and gif we made, sorting them and named them after que question number. We made it as easy as possible to 
find the plot related to any cell so you don't have to execute any part of the notebook. Moreover, those plots are directly
the ones generated by the notebook.
* If you want to execute the whole notebook, you would need to execute the very last cell first. It's a cell in the Annex that will
allow the creation of gifs, that we felt mandatory to visualize the evolution of the graphs, you would then be able to execute the
rest of the notebook in order.
