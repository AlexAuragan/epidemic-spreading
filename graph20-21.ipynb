    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> As you know, a new epidemic has overwhelmed the world, COVID-19 jeopardizes people and changes our habits. It is easy to realise that knowing how illnesses spread is vital to our own protection. How can we predict whether a disease will cause an epidemic, how many people it will infect, which people it will infect, and whether or not it is dangerous to society as a whole ? Also, how can we determine which techniques to use in fighting an epidemic once it begins ? One way to answer all of these questions is through <strong>mathematical modeling</strong>. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> In this work you will have to review different epidemic modelings relying all on the representation by graphs of a human network called a <strong>contact network</strong>. A vertex in a contact network represents an individual and an edge between two vertices represents a contact between two individuals. The disease only spread from individual to individual if they are in contact, so through the edges. This representation is actually really common in research, and a lot of state-of-the-art modeling are built over it. From these different models you will be asked to draw conclusions from experiments on varying contact networks</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> For readability and ease of use, this project will be carried on a Jupyter Notebook, hence code and question answering have to be written in this unique file. This is a <strong>DUO</strong> project, no group of one person will be accepted, the duo has to be composed of same TD group students, if the number of students in the TD group is odd we will accept one group composed of three students. It will be coded in Julia using the LightGraphs package. <strong>BEWARE:</strong> \n",

This is true for the flu, the cold, etc. However COVID-19 might create immunity for whom already got it and SIS can not take into account immune or dead persons. That is why we propose in this part to consider another model more adapted to COVID-19 called SIR. It stands for Susceptible $\\rightarrow$ Infected $\\rightarrow$ Recovered where the susceptible group contains those who remain susceptible to the infection, the infected group consists of those who not only have the disease but are also in the contagious period of the disease, and the recovered group contains those who were ill, got cured, are not contagious and can not get ill anymore.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> One limitation of SIR is that it does not model the reaction of humans when they feel the presence of the epidemic. Indeed, if feeling threaten or surrounded by infected, an individual may change its behaviors: wear mask, wash its hands, etc. This result in a smaller infection rate. That is why in this part we will also consider a variant of SIR called SAIR which stands for Susceptible $\\rightarrow$ Alert $\\rightarrow$ Infected $\\rightarrow$ Recovered. A susceptible individual becomes infected by the infection rate $\\beta_0$, an infected individual recovers and gets immune by the curing rate $\\alpha$, an individual can observe the states of its neighbors, then a susceptible individual might go to the alert state if surrounded by infected individuals with an alert rate $\\kappa$ on each contact with an infected, an alert inividual becomes infected by the infection rate $\\beta_1$ where $0<\\beta_1<\\beta_0$. In our simple SAIR model, an individual can not go back to a susceptible state when he got into the alert state.</p>\n",

    "    \n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"> The stochastic nature of infection propagation makes the estimation of the epidemic origin intrinsically hard: indeed, different initial conditions can lead to the same configuration at the observation time. Methods such as the distance centrality or the Jordan center try to approximate it. They both rely on spatial information by stating that the first infected is probably at the center of the cluster of infection. Mathematically:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The jordan center is expressed as $\\min_{v\\in \\mathcal{I}}\\max_{n\\in \\mathcal{I}}d(v,n)$ where $\\mathcal{I}$ is a connected component of the original contact network containing all infected and recovered vertices, and where $d(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the distance (= the shortest path) between 2 vertices (if not weighted graph each edge accounts for 1 unit). \n",
    "* The distance centrality is expressed as $\\min_{v\\in \\mathcal{I}}\\sum_{n\\in \\mathcal{I}}d(v,n)(\\delta_{n,I} + \\delta_{n,R}/\\alpha)$, where $\\delta_{n,I}=1$ if the vertex n is infected ($=0$ otherwise), and where $\\delta_{n,R}=1$ if the vertex n is recovered ($=0$ otherwise). You may note that in distance centrality we increase the weight of the recovered vertices by a factor $1/\\alpha$, it translates the fact that recovered vertices tend to be closer to the origin of the epidemic since they probably got ill before.\n",
